IMPLEMENTATION:

Steps:
1.	Pick a total of 4 pcs in the packet tracer application.
2.	We need 2 routers.
3.	We need a single switch.
4.	Give the appropriate IP addresses to the PCs accordingly.
5.	Test the network with the help of packets.

The experiment conducted in Cisco Packet Tracer involved designing,
configuring, and testing various network topologies, including a 2-switch
network connected via routers, a 2-router network, and a multi-PC network
connected via a switch/hub. The goal was to explore different aspects of
network connectivity, routing, VLANs, and basic IP addressing.
These skills are essential for designing and managing real-world networks,
ensuring reliable and efficient communication within and between networked systems.
