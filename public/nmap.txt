Network Discovery Tools : Zenmap

______________________Nmap features include: _______________________

• Host Discovery – Identifying hosts on a network. For eg., 
listing the hosts which respond to  pings or have a particular port open.
 
• Port Scanning – Enumerating the open ports on one or more target hosts. 

• Version Detection – Interrogating listening network services listening on
remote devices to determine  the application name and version number. 

• OS Detection – Remotely determining the operating system and some 
hardware characteristics of  network devices. 

______________Algorithm\Implementation Steps\Installation Steps: __________________

1. Download Nmap from www.nmap.org and install the Nmap Software with WinPcap Driver utility. 
2. Execute the Nmap-Zenmap GUI tool from Program Menu or Desktop Icon 
3. Type the Target Machine IP Address (ie.Guest OS or any website Address) 
4. Perform the profiles shown in the utility.

____________Types of Scans____________

Ping Scan:
➔ Checks if a host is online by sending ICMP echo requests
(basic network reachability test).

Intense Scan:
➔ Performs a deep scan with service/version detection,
OS detection, script scanning, and traceroute.

Regular Scan:
➔ A basic scan that checks open ports on a target without
extra detailed probing.

Quick Scan:
➔ Rapidly scans only the most common ports without doing
full service or OS detection.

Aggressive Scan:
➔ Conducts a very detailed scan with faster timing,
service detection, OS fingerprinting, and default script execution.
